    <description>EMEA_SOW_StandardBank_009: Requirement to notify (email) the Client owner when an opportunity is created on the Client by a different user (i.e., who does not own the Client). An Apex trigger sets the value of this field ONLY on Opportunity creation. A workflow then uses the value of this field (with other fields) to assess whether or not to notify the Client owner.</description>
