                        <p class="A"><span>A: </span>API portals are bridges between API providers and API consumers that provide information about the API at every stage of an API's lifecycle. API portals allow providers to expose and publicize their APIs, educate developer communities about them, provision user access, generate client keys and more. Marketplaces differ from portals as they aggregate many API providers into a single view and typically add search functions so developers can browse many different APIs.</p>

                        <p class="A"><span>A: </span>API stands for “Application Programming Interface.” An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

                        <p class="A"><span>A: </span>An API Product is when APIs are combined to give a certain amount of access for client app developers.

                        <p class="A"><span>A: </span>API Management allows us to secure access to the backend service of an API using client certificates. This is to establish trust between the consumer application and provider application.  This certificate will be required during the API subscription process.

                        <p class="A"><span>A: </span>A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.</p>
